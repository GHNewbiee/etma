:bulb: The best way to propose a feature is to open an issue first and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.

:warning: **Before submitting a pull request**, make sure it's targeting the right branch:
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: For documentation fixes, use master.
- :beetle: For bug fixes or new features compatible with the next version, use develop.
- :bug: For bug fixes incompatible with develop, use the support branch of the latest stable version.

Happy hacking and coding!  :simple_smile:
